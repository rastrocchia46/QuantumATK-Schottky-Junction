# Schottky Junction Simulation with QuantumATK

## ðŸ“¡ Project Summary
This project models a **Schottky junction** between **Silver (Ag)** and **Silicon (Si)** using **QuantumATK**. The goal was to analyse quantum transport properties through the junction under applied bias voltages ranging from 0 to 3 V.

### ðŸ§ª Key Objectives
- Simulate an Agâ€“Siâ€“Ag two-probe structure
- Calculate PLDOS (Projected Local Density of States) at multiple biases
- Analyse the Transmission Spectrum and identify conduction thresholds

### ðŸ›  Tools & Methods
- **QuantumATK** for device simulation
- **Semi-empirical Slater-Koster method** for computational efficiency
- **Bias scan** from 0 V to 3 V
- Visualization of tunnelling effects, forbidden regions, and band structure

### ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Transmission probability shows no conduction before 3V
- Clear tunnelling behaviour and band gap visualised via PLDOS
- Strong correlation between structural configuration and transport results

### ðŸ‘¥ Team
- Raffaele Strocchia  
- Andrea Trimarchi  
- Salvatore Turboli
