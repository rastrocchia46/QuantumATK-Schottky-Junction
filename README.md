# Schottky Junction Simulation with QuantumATK

This project focuses on the simulation and analysis of a Schottky junction composed of Silver (Ag) and Silicon (Si), carried out using the QuantumATK platform. The aim was to study the quantum transport properties of the junction, particularly how the conduction behaviour evolves with respect to the applied bias voltage.

The simulated structure consisted of a two-electrode configuration, with Ag and Si electrodes. A semi-empirical Slater-Koster model was chosen to balance physical accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing us to perform reliable simulations across a range of conditions.

A series of voltage sweeps (0 V to 3 V) were conducted to evaluate the transmission characteristics and the Projected Local Density of States (PLDOS) at the interface. The results revealed that the junction does not support significant electron conduction until a threshold voltage of approximately 3 V is reached. Beyond this point, a marked increase in transmission probability occurs, consistent with the crossing of the band gap and the onset of quantum tunnelling.

Visual analysis of the PLDOS and the transmission spectrum provided clear insights into the electron transport mechanisms at play. This includes the identification of forbidden energy regions, band alignments, and conduction pathways influenced by structural and material parameters.

The work not only contributed to a deeper understanding of quantum transport at metalâ€“semiconductor interfaces but also strengthened our practical skills in device modelling and collaborative scientific work.
